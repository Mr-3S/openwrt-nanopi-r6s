Subject: [PATCH 134/134] arm64: dts: rockchip: rk3588: Add I2S nodes

In addition to the five I2S/PCM/TDM controllers and the two I2S/PCM
controllers shared between the RK3588 and RK3588S SoCs, RK3588 contains
another four I2S/PCM/TDM controllers.

Add the DT nodes corresponding to the additional controllers.
